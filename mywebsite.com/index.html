                    which will briefly cover the purpose of this site followed by an "About Me" which hopefully will give you a better idea of who I am and why I've created this page.  
                    Here we'll cover the site design and breakdown of what you can expect to find here. You should also find an image of me on the right in Vancouver, and a blog post 
                    detailing my adventure to becoming a software developer and the experiences along the way.  Below in the footer you'll find an embedded twitter feed from my content 
                    creator account, an image mapped grid of different links to accounts about me and a field that you can fill out to sign up for all updates from me regarding my journey

                    I'm a married dad of a golden retriever currently working at Amazon as an Onsite Medical Representative.  
                    I started in this role because of my licenses and certifications in Healthcare and Emergency Medical Services.  
                    I've spent the last few years working on an ambulance in a commercial EMS system.  
                    I started prior to the Covid-19 pandemic and worked through the first couple years of the pandemic until the situation seemed contained.  
                    After Covid-19 was in endemic status and feeling as though I had completed my service to my community, 
                    I started looking at options on how to return to school through loans, programs or other employers.  
                    Fast forward to now and life is a bit slower albeit more chaotic.  I work a full time position at Amazon while attending Correlation One's Software developer course.  
                    In any spare time I like to hike and play tennis with my wife and dog, I'm also an avid gamer and content creator on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/leharmacist" style="color: aqua;">Twitch.</a>
                    <br><br>
                    I created this page to showcase my HTML capabilities for Project 2 of the Correlation One course, you can find links to more information about me throughout the page.  For your convenience, links 
                    to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tpstack/" style="color: aqua;">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/leharmacist" style="color: aqua;">Twitch</a> are here but have also been placed in the navigation bar atop the page.

                <p  class="pbg">
                    I started the Software Developer course in the beginning of April 2023 hoping to break into the tech field.  I wanted to work in programming and game design ever since 
                    I was a young boy who excelled at math, especially logic and reasoning puzzles as I always loved brain teasers.  I eventually started down other career paths but circled 
                    back to it being a possibility after starting to use excel last year and loving all of the functions I could put together.  Everything was a puzzle with an overlaying UI 
                    but it was amazing to see the kind of automation you could create behind the scenes with macros and functions.  I started poking around to see what programs Amazon offered, 
                    at the time the Amazon Technical Academy (ATA) existed but was not taking new applicants.  I continued to dig around until I found the Career Choice program through which I 
                    would start this program.  At first I wondered if I would be good enough, hoped I made the right choice.  To my pleasure, everything continued to click and I knew this is 
                    where I was meant to be.  Less than a month into the program I began setting up my next challenge, obtaining my BS in a computer science field.  I've enrolled with Southern 
                    New Hampshire University's online program as they are said to have one of the best Computer Science programs available online.
