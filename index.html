                    Hello and welcome to my website.  This site was created as and built upon during my time with Correlation One's Software Developer program.
                    It is intended to serve as a professional portfolio and showcase my abilities as a software developer.<br><br>

                <p  class="ps pbg">
                    Here we'll cover the site design and breakdown of what you can expect to find here. On all pages you'll find a Navigation bar in the header along with my personal branding, a main section with content pertinent to each page and a footer with links to my various accounts with a contact modal as well.<br><br>
                    In this article you'll have an "Introduction", which will briefly cover the purpose of this site.  An "About Me" which will give you a better idea of who I am, my history, my passions and my goals.

                    This site also includes "Patch Notes" page that showcases the different stages of development for this site as well as the changes made during each stage.<br><br>
                    As of the project 9, the "About Me" page is complete and ready to give you a better look into who I am and where I'm going from here.<br><br>

                <h2><span class="hdrbg">   About Me   </span></h2>
                <p  class="ps pbg">   
                    I'm a married dad of a golden retriever currently working at Amazon as an Onsite Medical Representative.  
                    I started in this role because of my licenses and certifications in Healthcare and Emergency Medical Services.  
                    I've spent the last few years working on an ambulance in a commercial EMS system.  
                    I started prior to the Covid-19 pandemic and worked through the first couple years of the pandemic until the situation seemed contained.  
                    After Covid-19 was in endemic status and feeling as though I had completed my service to my community, 
                    I started looking at options on how to return to school through loans, programs or other employers.  
                    Fast forward to now and life is a bit slower albeit more chaotic.  I work a full time position at Amazon while attending Correlation One's Software developer course.  
                    In any spare time I like to hike and play tennis with my wife and dog, I'm also an avid gamer and content creator on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/leharmacist" style="color: aqua;">Twitch.</a>
                    <br><br>
                    I created this site to showcase my HTML capabilities for the Correlation One course, you can find links to more information about me <a href="about.html" style="color: aqua;">here</a> or through the links at the bottom of the page.

                <h2><span class="hdrbg"> My journey as a software developer </span></h2>
                <p  class="ps pbg">
                    I began the Software Developer course in the beginning of April 2023 hoping to break into the tech field.  I wanted to work in programming and game design ever since 
                    I was a young boy who excelled at math, especially logic and reasoning puzzles as I always loved brain teasers.  I eventually started down other career paths but circled 
                    back to it being a possibility after starting to use excel last year and loving all of the functions I could put together.  Everything was a puzzle with an overlaying UI 
                    but it was amazing to see the kind of automation you could create behind the scenes with macros and functions.  As daunting as some of the more complex if-else nested functions looked, they eventually made sense and I was writing my own functions and designing my own sheets.  <br><br>I started poking around to see what programs Amazon offered, 
                    at the time the Amazon Technical Academy (ATA) existed but was not taking new applicants.  I continued to dig around until I found the Career Choice program through which I 
                    would start this program.  At first I wondered if I would be good enough, hoped I made the right choice.  Thankfully, everything continued to click and I knew this is 
                    where I was meant to be.  Less than a month into the program I began setting up my next challenge, obtaining my BS in a computer science field.  I've enrolled with Southern 
                    New Hampshire University's online program as they are said to have one of the best Computer Science programs available online.<br><br>

                <p class="ps pbg">
                    I've expanded this webpage from a localized file of code to a hosted website, we are on GitHub and Live!  This same update also brings the addition of a whole new page.  Check out the "Patch Notes" page in the new NavBar
                    to see how this site has grown through multiple iterations and additions in an accordion style interactive display.<br><br>
                    6/29/23 - I now have a completed About me page further detailing my experiences with technology and my history with both software and hardware.  With this expansion also brings a image slider and a dark mode/light mode toggle.<br><br>
